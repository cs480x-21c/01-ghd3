1. Graphics Used

Circle --> The circle is used in the top right corner of the page meant to symbolize a sun.
Rectangle --> The rectangle is used in 3 places. 
                1. The light blue rectangle is used to depict a sky. 
                2. The red/brown rectangle is used to depict the body of the house.
                3. The green rectangle is used to deptic the door of the house. 
Polygon --> The polygon is a triangle and used to make the roof of the house. 
Line --> The line is used to depict the chimney for the house. It looks like a rectangle because of the increased stroke-width.

3. Achievements

Technical --> One technical acheivement of this project is the way that I used the polygon. I experiemented with databinding to allow the dimensions of the triangle/roof to scale based on the size of the SVG. I did need a little help from StackOverflow to understand the syntax of how databinding worked. When I did it on my own I was unsure of how to make the arguments of the "points" attr be one string. SO helped with this. 

Design --> A design acievement of this project was that if the SVG dimensions are changed (granted it remains a square) the shapes should scale properly. To do this, the x and y coords are measured through math and the dimensions of the SVG file. So when the height and width var are updated the shapes should reflect this.
