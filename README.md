Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

1. Project contains: 1 circle, 1 rectangle, 3 polygons, 1 line with 4 segments
	This assignment reminded me of one I did in highschool, in which we had to write code for a CNC mill. I decided to recreate the design I did back then. I also coded everything such that it scales to the size of the window, without distorting the image. Note that it only rescales when the page is refreshed, in the future I'd like for my graphics to be able to scale in real time.
	
2. I used no other code, but did base it on the given d3 tutorials.
