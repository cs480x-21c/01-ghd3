Design Achievements:

This project was inspired by the solar system. I included the order of plants, as wll as 
the axis they all are on. I included some asteroids and other visuals as well.

The following image is what I used to create a model of the solar system order.

Vis Details
---

For this project you should use d3.js. 
You can learn from examples on the [d3.js](http://d3js.org) site or start from scratch.

See the [Using d3js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki#using) documentation for how to run your own local server.

Creative solutions are welcome! In the past I've seen recreations of paintings, interactives, and more.

Go beyond the minimum requirements of this project.
Experiment with other aspects of the [d3 API](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference) and [d3 Tutorials](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tutorials). 
Try making the elements interactive, for example, or animate them.

Grading
---

Grades are on a 120 point scale. 
96 points will be graded for functionality: the program does what the assignment requests with an informative README. 

We will use Google Chrome to view submissions. 
Be sure to test your code there.

Below are some, but not necessarily all, of the key points we will consider during grading:

- Circles and Rectangles  
- Lines  
- Polygons  
- Different colors  
- README Quality
    - A description of what you have created. 1-2 screenshots are recommended for the README.  
    - A working link to the hosted files (usually the gh-pages 'live' url)  
    - Section for Technical and Design Achievements

Technical Achievement Desription -- 12
