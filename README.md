Design Process:
After getting used to how to add shapes through d3, I decided to start trying to make some flags.
I started out easy by creating the japanese flag and progressively tried harder flags (Israel and Turkey).
All the desired shapes (rect, circle, line, polygon) have been used in multiple ways.

Here is a photo of what the github page looks like before interacting:

Design and Technical Achievement:
In terms of design, I believe the recreation of flags covers this as oppose to random shapes being drawn.
For technical achievement, try clicking on each flag, the console will log the name of the flags country as well as some change will be made.
    -Japan: circle will change color
    -Sweeden: flag will invert
    -Turkey: star changes to multiple colors
    -Israel: each shape disappears if you click it
