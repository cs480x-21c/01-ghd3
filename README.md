Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

Project Description
---

I implemented drawing circles, rectangles, lines, polygons using SVG and d3.js. I created a scene on my HTML page in which a sun rises and sets over a scene. I animated a yellow circle to rise and fall, and I also changed the color of a rectangle that represents the sky so that it looks like the rising and setting of the sun changes the color of the sky. I implemented a circle to represent the sun. I implemented 3 rectangles to represent grass, sky, and the base of a house. I implemented one polygon to represent the roof of the house. I implemented two black lines that overlap the top parts of the roof that act as an outline.

Technical Achievement
---

I used animation to make the sun on the HTML page rise up and down. Specifically, I appended an 'animate' element to the 'circle' element that represents the sun, in which I indefinitely change the 'cy' attribute of the circle to move up and down. I also appended an 'animate' element to the rectangle that represents the sky, in which I indefinitely change the 'values' attribute to change the color from a dark blue to a lighter blue to represent the change in day time to night time.

Design Achievement
---

My design achievement is creating a scene in which it looks like a sun is rising and setting. In the rising and setting of the sun, the sky also changes color so that it is the appropriate color for the time of day. This differs from my technical achievement because I adjusted the animation so that the sky color changes appropriately at the exact same time that the sun rises and sets. When the sun is at the lowest point on the page, the color of the sky is the darkest. When the sun is at the highest point on the page, the color of the sky is the lightest.
