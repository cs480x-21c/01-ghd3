Some of my favortie visualizations I've seen online over the years rely heavily on discovery and interactivity. I felt the best way to start learning D3 was to focus on this aspect of design. For this project I developed a game called Hot Streak that challenges the player to click the randomly selected circle in order to keep building a streak. If the player selects any other circle their streak resets and they have to restart it.

In order to meet project specifications I created the 4 by 4 array of circles using D3's ability to bind data to generate scalable elements. Thinking ahead to ways I could iterate on the project I would be able to generate variable dimensions for the array using my current method for creating rows using the modulo operator. I view implementing this array of circles as my techincal achivement and as for design achivement I worked to have most of my elements use viewport scalable attributes such as percentages and viewport values(vh and vw). Additionally the layout of the page is using flexbox.

For this project I utilized tutorialspoint D3.js found [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/d3js/d3js_introduction_to_svg.htm) to learn and begin working in D3 in order to create the primative shapes on my project site. I otherwise reffered to stack overflow for miscellaneous JS syntax issues.
