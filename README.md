Description:
  This is my minimalistic rendition of the well-known Bernie Sanders "meme".
  Rectangles were used to create the background/stairs. Circles were used to
  create eyes. The face was created using an ellipse. The mask and body,
  including the jacket and legs, were created using polygons. Lines were used
  to give dimension to the jacket(jacket sleeve lines).
  The mittens and glasses are images.

Minimal Requirements:
  I have used circles, rectangles, lines, and polygons in different colors to build my viz.


Technical Achievement Description:
  For this assignment, I have used data-binding principles to reduce the amount of code and make the process of making different shapes/objects easier.
Design Achievement Description:
  I decided to go for portrayal of a relevant picture to our current year. The design uses different shapes, colors to resemble the original picture.
