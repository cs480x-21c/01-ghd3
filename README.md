Hi, this is my first JavaScript homework with d3 :)
In this homework, I draw different shapes with different colors using d3.

I first draw all the requred shaped in the grading list (Lines, Polygons, Circles, Rectangles, Colors). Then I created a smile face using those shapes with different color and some extra design technics.

Technical and Design Achievements
---
Design:
Besides the essential requirement, I create a smiling face using those shapes with a different colours.

Technical:
The mouse is a little bit tricky. To create a Crescent shape, I used two different circles and overlapped them with each other. The circle at the top has the same colour as the background. I tried to make the mouse by using some transform function, but simple shapes are more comfortable to implement and work better.
