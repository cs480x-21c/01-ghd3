Overview:
---

The primary goal is to be able to generate graphics primitives (circles, rectangles, lines, polygons) at different locations on the screen with different colors.

This project was inspired by the solar system. I included the order of planets, as well as 
the axis they all are on. I included some asteroids and other visuals as well. I was able to change the color of the planets
when they are hovered over by a mouse. 

The following image is what I used to create a model of the solar system order.

This image is to show what happens when you hover over the 'Mars' planet. The circle increases in size and changes color.

This project consists of 9 circles that change color when hovered over by a mouse. There are also two lines connecting the 
circles to portray an axis on which the planets lie on. There are 8 squares/rectangles total which represent asteroids and other objects
that occur in outer space. On the bottom is a polygon that I used to represent a sky. 

I used Adobe's color picker to pick out different colors for all of the shapes in this project: https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel

Technical Achievements:
---
Every shape in this project used basic d3.js shapes. This started to become tedious so I think that
this would not have been very effective in a larger scale project. Through this project I learned how to use HTML, JavaScript, and Github.
I also learned some extra interactivity you can use in d3.js, such as transitions and mouseHover functions. I was able to learn
how to change the size and shape of the circles on the page through mouse events with d3.js. I looked online for examples on how to
develop SVGs as well as using the interactive features of d3.js.

Sources of Code:

The code to create SVG elements in index.html is based off examples seen here: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/d3js/create-svg-elements-in-d3js

I used this link to help me understand how transitions and mouse events work in d3.js: http://jonathansoma.com/tutorials/d3/clicking-and-hovering/
