The link for the live page: https://xchen0326.github.io/01-ghd3/

For this assignment, I used d3.js to draw several shapes with different colors. I also made a human face with the shapes.

Here is the link to the screenshot of my page: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tec1ZD-jQzMLOjKMRDF3XDSmbMF8RUidhYO_QQr8RI/edit?usp=sharing

1. Technical Achievement: For each of the rectangles, circles and lines, the color is different.
                          For every 1 second, the colors for the above will change to black and then change back.
2. Design Achievement: I made a human face sketch with a polygon, four circles and an ellipse.
