On the left of the screen is a red van that consists of a polygon filled with red (car body), a rectangle filled with aqua (window), and four grey-blue circles (wheels) layered to give the illusion of depth. Beneath the van is an orange line (road). To the viewer's right of the van is purple text that reads "when you pirate stuff from disney plus it's disney minus :)".

Hovering the cursor over the red polygon will turn the car green. Moving the cursor away from it will return it to its original red color.

There is no door in or out of the vehicle. help.
