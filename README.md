Description
===
I made my recreation of the WPI covid dashboard. The bar graph mimics the WPI style where the graph represents the total number of positive tests on a day. The visual differences I added is a line between each chart as well as a star marker over the day with the highest positive tests. Mousing over a bar highlights it and showes the number in the top left.

Requirements Fullfillment
---
- Rectangles: The bars of the bar chart are rectangles
- Lines: the lines connecting different bars are lines
- Polygons: A star above the # with the highest cases
- Different colors : Red for the star, black for trendline, steel blue for bars
- README See Below

Technical Achievement Desription
---
The best technical design achievement is that the entire chart can change based on the input data
Originally, this meant I wanted to pull the data from the WPI covid page but ran into some trouble.
However, everything is paramaterized to work as the data updates. 
The mouse in and out highlights the bar chart as well as shows the number of cases in the top left

Design Achievement Description
---
The design is clean I think for my first visualization. The space between the bars in the barchart was something I fiddled with for a while and I think I like how it came out. It's fairly pleasing to look at. 
The star for the highest number in the data is a nice design as well because when I look through the covid dashboard, I'm often looking for the highest number there, and try and figure out why that day had so much, and to see how many cases were on that day. There are also multiple stars
