The page starts out with a green line, a moving circle, three square, and a star

Hovering over the circle turns it red, and clicking on the circle removes the circle

Clicking on the yellow star turns it red and gives it a random stroke size (within certain bounds)

For technical achivement, I made it so that when you hover over certain elements, they change (gain an outline and change color)
When you click elements, they also have changes. Some dissapear, and some change how they look
The circle also is moving and continues to move back and forth until it is clicked

For design achivement, I used many different colors and included moving elements and text describing the page to try
and make it easier to understand
