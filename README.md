Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===
This project implements primitive shapes using d3.js in different colors. The shapes are:
1. Circles: Each circle represents a nominal data point of a particular category
2. Rectangles: Each rectangle represents a nominal data point of a particular category
3. Lines: Each line is used to draw the axes of the scatterplot
4. Polygons: Each polygon(triangle) is used to denote the arrows of the axes of the scatterplot

Technical Achievement Description
---
During this project, I learned basic Javascript from scratch as well as some basics of the library d3.js. I also experimented with data binding in implementing some shapes in d3 through the use of functions.

Design Achievement Description
---
During the project, I created a basic scatterplot using the shapes described above. I also made use of the "mouseover" and "mouseout" features to implement visual effects such as changing color of the shapes circle, rectangle and polygon.
