Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
For the assignment I created a pesuod interactive site, linked to at: https://scvoltmer.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html

![front page](https://ibb.co/NLDJ1gw)

![second page](https://ibb.co/MCs4nxV)

The page consists of 4 distinct objects that are interacted with. The page starts with a circle whose size is changed via slider, the site prompts the user to click on the circle, the circle tells the user to change the slider to a specific size and try again, once this is done the circle and slider dissapear a different shape appears, which in turn can be clicked on to reveal another shape. I made extensive use of alerts, because I find them very interesting.

I did not accomplish much in the way of design achievement, the page is admitedly very ugly. The technical achievment was mainly from figuring out how to do the label stuff as well as changing the size of the circle. The hardest part for me was making it so that the circle would only dissapear when the correct value was entered.
