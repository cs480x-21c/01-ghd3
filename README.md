<h1>Project Description</h1>

In project a1, I have created a react.js webapp that is hosted on heroku. On the project1 
page of this app I have made 4 react components to create svgs and then populate them using 
d3. The four components I made each correspond to a project requirment (Rectangle, Circle, 
Polygon, Line, Color). The circles use a function to randomly choose a radius, and selects 
the circles by a tag that they have set. 

<img src=“images/Circle1.png” raw=true alt=“Check1”></img>
<img src=“images/Circle2.png” raw=true alt=“Check1”></img>

The line incorperates a button which then uses d3 to select the line and create random start 
and end points within the container.
