Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

For this assignment I made a simple sailboat sailing during a sunny day.
A variety of basic shapes are used throughout the boat,
The hull and sails are created with polygons while the sun and waves are circles.
A rectangle is used for the mast and lines are used for the sun's rays.
The live project file can be found [here](https://cscholler.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html).

### Technical Achievements
Most of this project was guided using the example shown in class.
However, for some basic shapes that were not shown in class I used [Lulu's Blogs - Basic Shapes](https://lucidar.me/en/d3.js/part-06-basic-shapes/).
The note-worthy technical achievements of this assignment are the ocean, sun, and sails.
The ocean uses basic data binding to rapidly create multiple circles.
When moused over the sails change colors by using ".on" and a "mouseover" and a "mouseout".
The sun was created using basic data binding to trigonometric angles. 
These can be seen from the live page.

### Design Achievements
I'm not sure what my design achivements are. But what I can say I've work hard on is the sun's rays.
These rays are baised upon sin and cosine rather than just basic coordinates.
