Assignment 1 - Remy Allegro
===

For this assignment, I used the [code snippet from Lecture 1](https://wpi0-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ltharrison_wpi_edu/ETunJKUEx61ArpK7LGjA-PcBdiCAlHos2isOp56RnCyfVA?e=TtAXKg) as my starting point.
Information about primatives in d3 was found [here](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/shape.html)
Polygon code debugged with the help of [this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13204562/proper-format-for-drawing-polygon-data-in-d3).
Code for color transitions adapted from examples on the [d3 transitions repo](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition).

Achievements
---
I have a few modest achievements. In terms of technical achievements, I used some math functions to create the perfect hexagon I used as the basis for my design, using a dataset with x and y attributes. For design achievements, I figured out how to do color transitions, and implemented said transitions on the rectangle on the page.
